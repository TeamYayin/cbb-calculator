# üí≥ Credit Card Cashback Calculator Assignment

The aim of this project is to design a tool to **calculate cashback** for different credit cards based on transaction category, percentage rewards, and **monthly capping rules**. It also generates a **summary dashboard** of spend distribution by category. 

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Design a program that accepts:

* A **list of credit card rules** including cashback percentages and caps per category.
* A **CSV file of user transactions** that contains:

  * `Date`
  * `Amount`
  * `Transaction Type` (e.g., Airtel Recharge, Utility, Zomato, EMI, Others)

The system should compute:

* Cashback for each transaction according to the card‚Äôs rules.
* Capping for each cashback category.
* Total monthly cashback.
* A **visual breakdown (dashboard)** of total spends by category.

The system should support for multiple cards with different rules, User when uploading file should be prompted to select card variant.
